What is this?
=============

Just a simple tool to send emails to relatives or anyone who may want to see your latest pictures from flickr.  It will require that you have a flickr and a gmail account.  I'm not interested in supporting other setups because this works for me.  I'm really just storing this on github so anyone who wants can use this as well.

What you'll need
================

- Flickr account
- Flickr API key and shared secret
- Gmail account
- Installation of ruby

How to use it
=============

Make sure to copy the .relative-emailer.yml-SAMPLE file to your home directory (~/.relative-emailer.yml) and rename it without the -SAMPLE part.  Fill it out with the information you want.  You will need to get a flickr api key and shared secret.  If you don't know how to do that, just google for "flickr api".  It will create a simple html email which you can use to send to relatives which may not know how to use an rss feed and/or don't want to check flickr every couple of days.

The typical use of the script will look something like this:

ruby relative-emailer.rb

Just running the script barebones like that will send and email through your gmail account to anyone listed under "email_to" in the yml file.  That email will contain a feed from the last "default_days" (also listed in the yml file) of pictures and videos with links for each.

If you want to do a dry run and just see what it would have sent in the email simply add the option -dry.

ruby relative-emailer.rb -dry

Other command line options are -days 5.  Obviously that specifies the last number of days to select pictures and videos from.  Also -subject "Subject for email" is available.  The subject is defaulted to "Daily Flickr Digest".



Have fun!
